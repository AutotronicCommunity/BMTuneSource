ECT corrections are fuel and ignition adjustments based on engine coolant temperature.

ECT fuel corrections allow you to add or take away fuel based on
the engine coolant temperature.

The top box is the temperature point and the bottom box is the fuel adjustment to be
made in percentage. A negative value will take out fuel and a positive will add it in.
It also aids in cold startup and warming up the engine.

ECT ignition correction also aids in cold startup by adding ignition timing and starting
the ingition process earlier. This table will allow you to enter negative values to pull
timing at higher temperatures for safety.

Note: An extra temperature point is added in if you wish to adjust the scale to your liking.
