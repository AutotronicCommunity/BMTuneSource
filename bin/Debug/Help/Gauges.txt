You'll see lightsand gauges data windows.
To add extra lights or gauges, simply right click anywhere in the menu.

When you have your extra light and/or gauge, we can select what they
should show by right clicking on the light or gauge itself. In the menu that
pops up is a submenu titled "Set Type" which is where we'll choose the
options we want to display for each light or gauge.

For the gauges themselves there are extra options on certain items. You
can see the peaks values of the logging, display the back color by warnings
settings and much mores.

You can optionally resize the window to switch the view from horizontal to vertical.

Here's what an example gauge setup looks like:
