BOOST FUEL:
This sets how much additional fuel to add to the boost
portion of the basemap. The more efficent the turbo is, the higher you want
to set this number. A good starting point is usually 120-130% 

BOOST IGNITION RETARD:
This will retard a specified amount timing
per PSI(starting at the first boost column). A good starting point
is usually 0.75-1 degree of retard per PSI.

You can also use the Step Retard to retard from a specific amount by steps
of PSI.

BOOST COLUMNS:
You can set the amount of boost columns you want in you basemap.
More columns you have, more 'fluid/precise' the tables gonna be, it will do
steps less abrutly. A good starting point is usually 10-14 columns.
