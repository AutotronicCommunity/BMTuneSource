Smart Tracking will follow and switch tables automatically
using the datalog. This mean if you are doing a live tuning
sesion, and your ecu pass the conditions to switch maps, by
exemple you change to the secondary table, then smart track
will switch the shown table in BMTune automaticaly between
the primary and secondary table.

It will follow the datalog cursor.

Smart tracking is kinda like 'follow vtec' and 'follow secondary'
option activated together, it will follow all kind of maps
switching.
