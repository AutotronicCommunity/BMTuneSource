Type:
-TPS Based
-VSS Based

General:
Select which input(switch) you want to you use as activation
You can choose "always off" to disable FTL or "always On" to enable it full time
This can be a clutch swith or a on/off toggle switch.

TPS Based:
The driver can adjust the launch rpm on the fly. Just rev to that rpm point
and cross the tps engage threshold after that you can give less tps but the lock will stay.
If you drop below the disengage threshold the lock is removed.

Enter the mimimum rpm for 2-Step cut to work. Putting this to low(when always enabled) 
can cause ftl locks in city traffic. High tps and low minimum rpm will cause FTL to engage.
2-Step will be active below the disired vss.

TPS engage: If you cross the tps threshold the rpm will be lock
TPS disengage:If you come below this tps threshold the rpm lock will be released

VSS Based:
Specified rpm where the 2-Step will cut
2-Step will be active below the disired vss.
To use clutch based just select in activation input that is connected to the clutch.

HOW TO MAKE FLAMES:
First make sure igntion cut is enabled in the Rev Limits parameters.

To create flames/pops on a n/a engines you dont need the antilag to be activated,
antilag serve only for bossted setup to produce boost and also louder pops at the
same time. Add some cut delay to cut the launch for a slight longer time, allowing
you cylinder to get enought fuel (ignition cut not fuel cut) and when the engine
turn On again (ignition turning on) it should light all the unburnt fuel.
