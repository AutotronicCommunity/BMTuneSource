LABEL1=
The Live Plits can display more possibly useful
information graphically when doing a live tuning
session and datalogging. This will display the
informations of somes (or the majority) of the
sensors in the previous datalog frames.

AFR vs TIME:
This will show the AFR values over the previous
datalog frames.

Map/AFR vs RPM:
This will show the average AFR at different RPM

CUSTOM vs TIME:
You can datalog almost any sensor graphically over
the previous amount of choose frames.

If you have an issue, lets say by exemple your iacv
trigger On and Off quickly and you want to see
graphically on live tuning how the iacv perform,
this display will be very helpful to you.
