Ignition Dwell settings are for advanced users only. Please do not play with these settings
if you don't understand what they're for.

The RPM Based Ignition Adjustments are adjustments applied to the ignition value based on RPM.

RPM Based Dwell Control allows you to adjust the charge time of the coil by altering the
cam angle at which the charge starts.

Battery Voltage Based Dwell Multiplier is the value based on battery voltage that is multiplied by
the cam angle from the RPM Based Dwell Control to product the final dwell values.
