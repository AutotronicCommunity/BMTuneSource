Map sensor settings allows you to choose from the many preset map sensors
or enter values for a custom sensor.

Changing the map sensor will automatically rescale your maps for the new sensor
and try to keep the load settings as close as possible to what they were with the
previously selected sensor. If you select a sensor that does not read as high as the
previous sensor it will set any values above the new sensors range to the highest
pressure it is capable of, essentially the maximum setting the sensor can see.

For custom sensors, make sure you have your settings in there before you choose
custom and then you can adjust from there.

You can set the map sensor settings by either two way:
-The Minimum and Maximum voltage (0v-5v)
-The mBar/Volt scale
