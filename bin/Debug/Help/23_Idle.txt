Idle RPM is controllable through BMTune  via the Idle Air Control valve located on
the back of your intake manifold.

The target idle is the RPM you want to idle at once the car has warmed up.

The idle air control valve duty cycle adjustment can be used to control how much air
is allowed to pass through to the intake manifold. Going negative will allow less air to
pass through and going positive will allow more air to pass through.

The ECU will try to correct and reach the target idle anyway, but if you go too far it
won't be able to and your idle may bounce around or suffer.

Disable IACV error allows those who no longer have the idle air control valve plugged
in to continue on without a check engine light and resulting error code.

Startup idle gives you the ability to adjust the target idle for engine coolant
temperature during the warmup process.

To help the vehicle warm up quickly and properly a higher target idle is specified.
The top box is the engine coolant temperature in either celcius or fahrenheit depending
on your preference setting and the bottom box is the target idle setting for that
temperature.

The ECU interpolates between the temperature setting below and above the current
temperature and picks an RPM in between the target settings for both.

It is best to set the target settings for normal operating temperature to match the target
idle rpm above. Other factors also effect the startup process.
