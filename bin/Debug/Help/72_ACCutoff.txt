AC Cutoff allows you to switch your AC output off based on throttle position or
RPM to free up the load on the engine created by the AC compressor.

Enable AC Cutoff turns on the cutoff parameters and starts disabling your AC
output at the settings provided immediately. If the RPM is above the set RPM
point OR the throttle position is above the set TPS point your AC will be disabled.
