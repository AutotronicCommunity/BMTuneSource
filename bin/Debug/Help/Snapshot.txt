Snapshot Tool allow you to save several instance of your
current tune during your current tuning session.

Let's take by exemple, you make severals dyno pull and apply
severals change in between each pull but at a certain point you
want to rollback on your previous changes quickly or simply compare
them with your current pull, the Snapshot is there for this. you can
save a snapshot after each pull you do and reload it later if needed.
