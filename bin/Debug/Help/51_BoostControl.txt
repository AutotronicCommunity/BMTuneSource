Boost control allows you to use the outputs of the ECU to activate a boost
controller with on/off solenoids such as the Turbo XS dual or quad stage controller.

Enable boost control allows boost control to be activate based on the settings in the window.

Disable if there's an MIL code allows boost control to remain inactive
when there is an error code present which is a safety net for your engine.


Activation input allows you to hook up an on/off pull to ground switch to
any of the inputs listed in the menu. When set to none it will only be active
based on the parameters in the window, but when an input is selected 
boost control will only be active when the switch is set to on.

Invert input allows you to use switches that are grounded in the off
position instead of the on position.

Secondary thru Fourth stage boost setting allows you to activate the second
stage of boost via the output selected in the menu above the speed set in the 
speed box above it. When set to none no output will be activated. When an
output is selected and the speed is set to 0 the output will be active anytime
the car is moving.
