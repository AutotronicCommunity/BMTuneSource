Emulator Types :
-Moates Ostrich 1 and 2
-Moates Demon 1 and 2
-Romulator
-PGMFI EasyRTP

Choose your emulator type to use for the realtime. You can set manually a
COM Port or simply use the 'Auto-Scan' feature.

If you want to set it manually, the recommanded baud for moates devices
are 921600 for emulator and 38400 for the datalogger.

Sampling rate:
Lower your sampling rate is, faster your datalog gonna be. Too fast on
slow computer can create lags.

Note:
-You can't change the datalogging port/settings with the demon because
 it's the same usb port than the realtime emulating.
-If you manage to connect to your emulator but cannot upload any file
 you might want to increase the timeout time.
-If you have issue connecting to your emulator or datalogger, please refer
 to the Debug menu.
