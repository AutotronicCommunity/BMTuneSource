Anti-lag helps you build boost(spool turbo) at the start line when 2-Step is active. 
You can pre-stage on 2-step and the tps threshold decides when anti-lag starts.
Anti-lag start pulling timing and throw extra fuel above tps threshold(only when 2step active)

Insert the amount of fuel to dump during anti-lag(Fuel value between 0 -255)

WITHOUT STATIC IGNITION:
Insert the amount of retard during anti-lag(postive value)
The anti-lag value will be substracted from the final ignition.
Otherwise it will be substracted from the ignition table lookup.
By exemple : if you put a value of 45, and your final ignition are 42,
                       the antilage final ignition will be -3;

WITH STATIC IGNITION:
You can also use the static option. Rather than substracting the retard number, it will
set the ignition at the number definied.
By exemple : if you put a value of -6, the antilag final ignition will be -6.

Note: Anti-lag disengage as soon as the wheels spin
