Options listed here are used to enable/disable sensors and extras.

ECT, IAT, VSS Error Code:
When one of each other are disable, you will be prompt to put the value
of the sensor when its disabled, by exemple if you disable the ECT Sensor
and you ecu has no more ECT reference, you will tell the ecu that the ECT
temperature are fix at this amount.

When disabling ECT, IAT or VSS sensor, the ecu can possibly jump directly
to the SET value even if the sensor still have reading.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DISABLE THIS ONLY IF REQUIRED

Ignition Correction:
Ignition adjustments occur all the time. The ECU alters the ignition based on many variables
like map sensor voltage, throttle changes, and even rpm changes causing the actual ignition
timing to differ from the maps. Unchecking this checkbox allows you to disable adjustments
above the specified load. This will give you full control of ignition timing since it will only run
what's in the maps, gear correction, individual cylinder correction, iat correction, and
ect correction.

The load settings allows you to keep a completely stock partial throttle drivability while
still giving you full control at higher loads or in boost.

Ignore starter signal input allows you to tell the ECU to ignore this input so you can use
it as a switch input for any one of the other options available.
