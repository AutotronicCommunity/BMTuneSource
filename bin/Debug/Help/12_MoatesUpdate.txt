Since the hardware is a Moates product, it required the 'Moates Firmware Updater'
utility be used to update the firmware.

First download the firmware updater on www.moates.net

To update the Demon firmware first plug in the Demon. Quit all other applications 
to ensure the firmware is delivered without any complications. Launch the Moates
Firmware Updater application. If it says Not Detected, make sure the unit is plugged
in and hit detect again.You should see your units firmware version listed in the
current firmware version section. If it says 1.09.D then you are already up to date. 
If it says 1.08.D you will need to update. Choose browse and select the provided file
in the same folder. It should say 1.09.D in the Updated Version section of the image details.
Hit Update. The progress bar will run and you will get a message that your Demon
Firmware update was successful.

Enjoy the update!
