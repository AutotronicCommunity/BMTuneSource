Intake air temperature settings allow you to adjust fuel and ignition based on the
intake air temperature at different loads.

On Low, Medium, and High load fuel trim settings the top box represents the
intake air temperature and the bottom box represents the amount of fuel
correction in plus or minus percentage.

Ignition correction allows you to add or pull ignition timing based on the intake
air temperature in the top box. There are two IAT ignition adjustments.
One is applied at all times and the other is for high load only.
