You can set a wideband to be read by the ecu or only used for datalogging.

First select your desired ecu input if you want the ecu to read the wideband or
choose a serial input if you want the software to read directly from the wideband.

Select your wideband brand, if its not listed you can set the voltage table manually.
Set your offset correction if the software read a different value from
what the wideband read.

Select your fuel type.

If you are using the ecu input, don't forget to activate the wideband option in
the closeloop settings and make sure the ecu are in closeloop.

You can use your wideband on D14 (original O2 Input) but the ecu will only
read 0-3.73V and not the full 0-5V analog voltage.

Using D10-ELD Input:
To use the full 0-5v band on the D10-ELD Input you should look at the resistors
R136, R137, and R138 and follow:
-R136, you need to remove this resistor
-R137, you need to make sure the resistor are in place and intact
-R138, you need to remove this resistor
