Full throttle shift settings are used to hold the engine at a certain RPM while shifting
with the throttle pressed. Holding the engine at the RPM you will be at when switching
into the next gear will make it a much smoother transition.

To use this feature the Enable Full Throttle Shifting option must be checked and you
should have a clutch switch wired up.

The cut RPM is the specific RPM that the engine won't be allowed to rev over.

Above tps is the tps at which the 2-step will no longer be active and 
full-throttle shifting can become active.

Clutch input is the input used for the clutch switch you have wired in.
Invert input should be active if you are using a switch that pulls to ground
in the off position instead of the on position.

You can also use an extra antilag
