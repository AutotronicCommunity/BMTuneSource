Individual cylinder trim settings allow you to adjust more or less
fuel/Ignition on per cylinder basis.

This can be used to even out the burn on cylinders that run hotter than others.
This also gives you complete control to match exhaust gas temperatures on
all 4 cylinders if you have the right equipment to watch the temperatures.
