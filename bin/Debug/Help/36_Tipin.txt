The top section hosts all of the conditions necessary to activate TPS Tip-In Correction.
TPS Required Change is the TPS Raw representation of how many steps the
TPS needs to change before the condition is met.

The Based Retard Per RPM is the base amount of retard applied when TPS Tip-In
Correction is active. This value is then multiplied by the TPS Correction Multiplier
and the Gear Correction Multiplier to get the final retard amount.

The Duration Per Gear allows you to adjust the amount of time in ms that
the correction is applied.
