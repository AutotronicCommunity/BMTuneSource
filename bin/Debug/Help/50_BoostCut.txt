Boost cut allows you to stop the engine's combustion process if it sees above
a load you feel is safe. The ECU will stop combustion until the RPM has
dropped and then your power will be restored.

Enabling boost cut with the checkbox will immediately turn on its capabilities
so make sure your load settings are not below what you're idling at or it will start to cut.

Below the hot/cold temperature threshold the ECU will use the load value
next to cold cut. Above the hot/cold temperature threshold it will use the load
values labeled "Hot" based on the low/high boost input.
