Rev limits are used to control an engine's RPM by cutting fuel or ignition to
prevent the combustion of the air/fuel mixture. This being the case, a rev limit
cannot prevent mechanically enduced over revving such as downshifting
into 2nd gear instead of going into 4th.

The low cam rev limit is for non-vtec setups or also used as a cold limit
while the engine warms up before VTEC will engage.

The high cam rev limit is used while in VTEC only or on the
High Cam Maps activation.

The limit is the RPM the cut happens and the restart is the
RPM it goes back to normal.

You can choose to cut fuel, ignition, or both. This setting is used for rev limits
and 3-step. As the warning states, disabling both options will leave you with
no ECU controlled rev limit. This can be utilized if you have an external box,
such as an MSD unit, that controls your rev limit.
