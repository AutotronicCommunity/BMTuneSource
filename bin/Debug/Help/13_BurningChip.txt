This feature will read/write/verify chip with Moates Burn1/Burn2 and BMBurner

1. Select your chip model first before doing any action
2. Select your region area (if its a 64kb chip, if it's a 32kb you can't select
   the region area)
  
I recommanded to use the area 8000-FFFF for SST chips (see explaination bellow)

Region Area Explaination:
the region area the the region you want to burn your file on the chip. Since our
tune file are only 32kb and SST chip are 64kb, we don't use all the space available.

The region are in 'Hexadecimal' and represent the location where the First (or the last)
byte are writen on the chip.

A file of 32kb (32kilo-bytes) is precisely 32768 bytes, if you convert 32768 into
Hexadecimal we obtain 0x8000. We have 0x8000 bytes to write on the chip.

SST Chip are 64kb (64kilo-bytes), which is precisly 65535 bytes, if you convert
65535 into Hexadecimal we obtain 0xFFFF. We have 0xFFFF bytes of space on the chip.

By default, the pin A15 on the SST chip are set to 5V which allow us to only read the
second half partition of the SST chip (from byte 32768 to 65535). If you now convert
the location into Hexadecimal we obtain 0x8000 to 0xFFFF.

2Timer:
The '2Timer' will switch between two full tune file on the same 64kb chip.

Since SST chips are 64kb and our baserom file are only 32kb, with a 2Timer
you can switch between 2x files on the same chip by asserting 5V or grounding the
pin A15 on the SST chip.

The area 0000-7FFF can now be used when the 2Timer get active on a 64kb chip,
and the area 8000-FFFF are used when the 2Timer are not active (default).

If you have a 2Timer, you can select to burn the full chip region (0000 to FFFF) and
you will be prompt to choose your second file to use when the 2Timer get active.

Invert location for 2Timer will invert the location of the first and second file.
This mean the second file are now used when the 2Timer are not active by default.
