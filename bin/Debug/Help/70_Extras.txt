SERVICE CHECK CONNECTOR
The SCC Input allows you to choose what input to use to set the ECU
into service mode to check codes or set timing. This can also be set to none to allow
the service connector to be used as an input for a switch based option elsewhere
in the software. When set to none, you can check your codes by having the car off,
key on, and the gas pedal to the floor. While checking codes, either regularly or via
the gas pedal, you can hold the brake pedal down to clear your current codes.

FUEL PUMP CONTROL
Fuel pump settings allows you to determine when the fuel pump is active.
Under the normal setting it will act as stock. You can also set it to be always
on or always off (For security or testing purposes). You also have the ability
to adjust the prime duration when the key is first turned to on.

IGNITION LOCK
Lock Ignition allows you to lock ignition timing at the specified value for setting base
timing and other applications.

PROTECT MAPS
Protect Maps can be used to protect your binary save file (.bin) from being opened in
BMTune and used by others tuners. You cannot open your binary save once it's protected,
so make sure you have your backup without this protection. Protected save can be burned
with external burning softwares (ex: moates flash and burn) or simply burned with the
internal chip burning function. If you use the internal function, you will be warned that
the binary gona be protected before burning.

MIL FLASHES
If you put a number higher than 0 the MIL will flash 'X' time when turning the car key On.
This can be used to recognize who tuned the car in your region if you are the only one using
this features nearby with the same amount of flash.
