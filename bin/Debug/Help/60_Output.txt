When the Enable Output checkbox is checked the chosen output will be
activated based on the conditions set below.

Activation Input is the input to be used with a switch or when set to none
will activate based solely on the conditions set below. Invert Input is used
when you have a switched that is grounded when off.

Output is the output you want activated when all conditions are met. 
Invert Output can be used to have the output be on when conditions are not
met and off when conditions are met. You can also choose to Switch Maps
On Output which will immediately run off of the secondary maps when all 
conditions are met giving you the ability to fully tune for Nitrous for instance
on completely separate maps.

Disable Output If MIL Code is present can be a safety option to not allow
the output to activate when there's an error code present.

Disable On FTL/FTS Activation can be used as a safety net to disable the
output during 3-step usage.

Except for TPS, all conditions have a minimum and a maximum setting to widen
the array of uses. The TPS threshold is minimum only.

While the output is active you can add or subtract fuel and ignition timing per
rpm point. RPM points can be adjusted separately for fuel and ignition trims.
