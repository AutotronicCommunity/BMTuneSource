Injector calibration settings allows you to easily scale for new injectors.

Stock injector size is the size of injector you had stock.

New injector size should be entered as your new injector size and
not changed if it runs lean or rich.

When you change the injector sizing BMtune will ask you if it can set
the TPS Tip-In Trim and Cranking Trim with base values for the
injector sizes you've entered.

Overall fuel trim can be used to add or subtract fuel on top of what the
stock/new injector sizes trim the fuel to. Bigger injectors can take longer
to open causing it to run a little lean even though you have the correct
stock and new size injector values entered. You can add or subtract a
percentage in the overall trim to get it back to where you want it.

The amount needed will vary for different cars as well as different brand injectors and sizes.

TPS tip-in trim is used to adjust the amount of fuel added in on quick throttle changes.
For bigger injector sizes you will want to enter a negative percentage to take out fuel otherwise
too much will be thrown in causing your vehicle to bog. This value will vary based on your
intake manifold, throttle body, and other variables in your setup.

Cranking trim is used to adjust the amount of fuel the injector puts out during cranking.
For bigger injector sizes you will want to enter a negative percentage to limit the amount
of fuel thrown in. The value here will add or subtract the percentage from the settings in
the raw cranking values. If it ends up starting great at warm temperatures and not so
great at cold temperatures you can adjust the raw cranking values to get it perfect
across the temperature range.

Tip-in and Cranking should be a negative percentage value based on old injector
size divided by new injector size. 240/440 is -45.5 for instance.

Post start is the amount of fuel delivered immediately after startup. Usually you will
not have to change this value from 0, but if you experience any issues you
have the option.

Post Start Fuel Rate of Decay determines the time taken for the extra post-start fuel to diminish
to zero. Higher values (rates) of decay will decrease the fuel more quickly than lower values. 

There are four steps to the decay table. 
-Step 1 is used until the post-start fuel has diminished to 50% of its initial value
-Step 2 is used until 25%
-Step 3 is used until the post-start fuel decreases to zero
-Step 4 is a special case when the intake air temperature is very high (~70C/~170F degrees).


Injector offset: you can choose to put your injector offset settings manually if
your injector brand aren't listed in the list or if you needed to modify it.
