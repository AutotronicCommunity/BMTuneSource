Map settings allows you to set the load type for the primary and secondary set of
maps separately.

If you want to use one set of maps (high cams/secondary maps), you can
check the settings. This will allow the vehicle to only run
on the high cam maps and/or secondary maps only.

Primary and secondary maps can be set to read based on the MAP sensor or the
TPS sensor completely separate to allow full TPS tuning, full MAP tuning, or a
mix of the two using Alpha-N. Alpha-N can come in very handy for ITB setups.
