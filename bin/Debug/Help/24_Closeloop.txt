Closed loop settings allows you full control of close loop.

When using a wideband 0-5v for closed loop please be aware you may need
to lower the minimum and maximum allowable adjustment to avoid it pulling
or adding in too much fuel.

To disable closed loop all the time simply uncheck the checkbox
labeled Closed Loop Enabled.

Enabling wideband will Invert Closed Loop Operation the way closed loop operates.
In stock form it is looking for a higher voltage to designate a rich condition and
a lower voltage to designate a lean condition. This is backwards from how most
widebands operate.

O2 Input allows you to choose which of the available inputs you have
your wideband hooked up to.

Disable Closed Loop Above Load will allow you to specify the maximum load that
closed loop will remain enabled. Good for supercharged setups that can build
boost without much throttle.

Disable Closed Loop Above RPM, Below ECT, and Below IAT allow for a little more
depth on the conditions for which closed loop can be active.

Target oxygen sensor voltage allows you to specify the target that closed loop will
shoot for in it's fuel trims. This is good if you have a wideband with narrowband
output and would like to specify a target voltage that's different than that of stock.

Disable by throtte position. This is how closed loop is disabled in stock form.
Per the RPM in the top box closed loop is disabled at the Disable TPS throttle
position and re-enabled at the Enable TPS position.

Use open loop VE tables above engine coolant temperature uses the VE table map
to add enrichments when in open loop. Unchecking the checkbox will run off of
the fuel maps only and not add the enrichment value from the open loop VE map.
If it is enabled, it will only kick in above the engine coolant temperature specified
to allow you more control over startup enrichments before closed loop kicks in.
