VTEC Settings are conditions and settings for which VTEC will be engaged and disengaged.
High and Low load engage are the RPMs to engage based on whether you're below or above
the High/Low load setting.

Disengage Delay is how many RPM below the engage RPM to disengage VTEC. With VTEC
set to engage at 5500RPM a Disengage Delay of 500 would disengage VTEC at 5000RPM.

Minimum Load, Speed, and Engine Coolant Temperature settings are the thresholds in which
to allow VTEC to engage.

Disable Below Load Threshold will disable VTEC any time the load gets below the threshold in
the load setting and kick back in once all conditions are met again.

VTEC Options can be used to disable VTEC for non-VTEC setups or disable a few of the checks
that prevent VTEC from engaging. Disable VTEC Error Check will allow VTEC to engage even with
a check engine light that would normally prevent VTEC operation. 

You can also use an alternative VTEC output if your ecu aren't designed to be VTEC.
