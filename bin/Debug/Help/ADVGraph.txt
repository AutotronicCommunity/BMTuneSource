The Advanced Graph display can show you almost or
all table informations in 2D to view more visually
if our table is smooth or not.

You can also edit tables values directly by selecting
a point and moving it with the mouse.

To open the Advanced Graph, you simply need to do a
right clic on the table (in the parameters) that you
want to display in 2D and select 'Show in graph'.

Be careful has it can be sensitive.
