Switch Maps allow you to set parameters to switch to the secondary set of maps instead
of using the primary set.

The input can be used with a simple switch to easily go between a
pump gas tune and a race gas tune.

The Load condition can allow you to switch maps at a specific load to have a wider area
of boost tuning available to you with the secondary maps making it a full 48x48 extended
map if you want.

The Throttle Position condition can allow you to switch maps at a certain point for ITB setups 
to run between MAP and TPS based load.
